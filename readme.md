## JS-Snake

This is an implementation of the Snake game with gradual speed increasing in the Canvas Javascript API. Use WASD to move, click r to reload the game and p to pause. Clicking f will open the game in full screen and clicking it again will reverse back to normal.

The game is mobile-friendly. Double-tap to play full screen and swipe in the direction you would like to move. Pausing and Reloading are not implemented on mobile.

Enjoy!
